**Problem Statement ID:** SIH26101  
**Organization:** Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI)  
**Department:** Data Informatics & Innovation Division (DIID)

## Overview

**Samarth Setu** is an AI-powered skill intelligence and learning platform designed for officials working in India's Official Statistical System.

The platform identifies competency gaps, recommends personalized training aligned with the **iGOT Karmayogi** ecosystem and **NSSTA/TPAC** programmes, and generates **MCQs and quizzes from uploaded learning material** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models.

---

## Problem

Officers in India's Official Statistical System require continuous upskilling in modern statistical, technical, and digital skills. Existing learning platforms offer generic courses with:

- No visibility into an officer's own competency profile
- No structured skill-gap assessment for Official Statistics roles
- No personalized learning pathway aligned with job roles
- Manual, slow, and inconsistent MCQ creation for training
- No dashboard to measure how training improves competency over time

---

## Solution

Samarth Setu addresses these gaps through a single integrated platform:

| Module | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Competency Profiling** | Builds a structured profile per officer across 4 domains |
| **AI-Based Assessment** | Benchmarks current proficiency against role requirements |
| **Skill-Gap Analysis** | Identifies gaps with HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW priority |
| **Personalized Recommendations** | Recommends courses from iGOT Karmayogi and NSSTA/TPAC |
| **AI MCQ Generation** | Generates context-aware MCQs from uploaded PDFs using RAG + LLM |
| **Progress Tracking** | Tracks competency improvement and training history |
| **Dual Dashboards** | Learner view + MoSPI/DIID admin view |
